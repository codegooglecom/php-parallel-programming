PHP parallel processing library currently supports only synchronous forking on *unix platforms.

Future roadmap:
 - Windows platform support
 - Asynchronous parallel processing
 - Control number of parallel processes instead of forking large number of command scripts
 - Handling killed/terminated processes
 - Better error exception handling
